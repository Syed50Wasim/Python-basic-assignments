1. What are escape characters, and how do you use them?
Ans:-
Escape characters in programming are special sequences of characters that have a specific meaning and are used to represent characters that would otherwise be difficult to include in a string or to perform certain formatting or control actions within a string. 
# Newline \n: Inserts a newline character in the string, causing text to start on a new line.

# In[1]:


print("Hello\nWorld")

Tab \t: Inserts a tab character, which is often used for indentation or formatting.
# In[2]:


print("Hello\tWorld")

Single Quote \' and Double Quote \": Allows you to include single or double quotes within a string that is enclosed by the opposite type of quotes.
# In[3]:


print("She said, \"Hello!\"")

Backslash \\: Escapes a literal backslash character.
# In[4]:


print("This is a backslash: \\")


# In[5]:


print("\u03A9")  # Omega (Î©)

2. What do the escape characters n and t stand for?
Ans:-
\n (Newline): This escape sequence represents a newline character. When you include \n in a string, it causes the text following it to start on a new line. It's commonly used to create line breaks in strings and format text for multiline output
\t (Tab): This escape sequence represents a horizontal tab character. When you include \t in a string, it inserts a tab character, which is typically used for indentation or formatting. It produces a consistent amount of space (or "tab") to align text.3.What is the way to include backslash characters in a string?
Ans:-
To include a backslash character (\) in a string in Python, you can use an escape character (\\). This means that you need to use a double backslash to represent a single backslash in the string.
# In[6]:


my_string = "This is a backslash: \\"
print(my_string)

By using \\, you escape the first backslash, which tells Python to treat the second backslash as a literal character and not as the beginning of an escape sequence. 4. The string "Howl's Moving Castle" is a correct value. Why isn't the single quote character in the
word Howl's not escaped a problem?
Ans:-
Mixed Quotes: In Python, you can use either single quotes (') or double quotes (") to enclose a string. When you use one type of quote to enclose a string, you can include the other type of quote character inside the string without any issues. In this case, the string is enclosed within double quotes, so the single quote within "Howl's" is considered a regular character and does not need to be escaped.

Escape Sequences: If you need to include a quote character that matches the string's delimiter, you can use an escape sequence to escape it. For example, if the string were enclosed in single quotes, you could escape the single quote within "Howl's" like this: 'Howl\'s Moving Castle'. However, in your provided string, double quotes are used as delimiters, so there is no need to escape the single quote.5.How do you write a string of newlines if you don't want to use the n character?
Ans:-
If you want to write a string with newlines in Python without using the \n escape sequence (the "n" character), you can use triple-quoted strings, specifically triple-quoted strings with double quotes """ or single quotes '''. Triple-quoted strings can span multiple lines and preserve newline characters within the string.6.What are the values of the given expressions?
'Hello, world!'[1]
'Hello, world!'[0:5]
'Hello, world!'[:5]
'Hello, world!'[3:]
# In[8]:


'Hello, world!'[1]


# In[7]:


'Hello, world!'[0:5]


# In[9]:


'Hello, world!'[:5]


# In[10]:


'Hello, world!'[3:]

So, the values of the given expressions are:

'e'
'Hello'
'Hello'
'lo, world!7. What are the values of the following expressions?
'Hello'.upper()
'Hello'.upper().isupper()
'Hello'.upper().lower()
# In[11]:


'Hello'.upper()


# In[12]:


'Hello'.upper().isupper()


# In[13]:


'Hello'.upper().lower()

So, the values of the given expressions are:

'HELLO'
True
'hello'8. What are the values of the following expressions?
'Remember, remember, the fifth of July.'.split()
'-'join('There can only one'.split())
# In[14]:


'Remember, remember, the fifth of July.'.split()


# In[16]:


'-'.join('There can only one'.split())

So, the values of the corrected expressions are:

['Remember,', 'remember,', 'the', 'fifth', 'of', 'July.']
'There can only be one'9. What are the methods for right-justifying, left-justifying, and centering a string?
# Right-Justify: To right-justify a string within a specified width, you can use the str.rjust(width, fillchar)method. It adds spaces  to the left of the string to make it reach the desired width.

# In[17]:


#Example
text = "Hello"
justified_text = text.rjust(10)  
print(justified_text)


# Left-Justify: To left-justify a string within a specified width, you can use the str.ljust(width, fillchar) method. It adds spaces to the right of the string to make it reach the desired width.

# In[19]:


#Exapmle
text = "Hello"
justified_text = text.ljust(10)
print(justified_text)


# Center: To center a string within a specified width, you can use the str.center(width, fillchar) method. It adds an equal number of spaces to both the left and right sides of the string to center it within the width.

# In[20]:


#Exapmle
text = "Hello"
centered_text = text.center(10)  
print(centered_text)

10. What is the best way to remove whitespace characters from the start or end?
Ans:-

The best way to remove whitespace characters from the start or end of a string in Python is to use the str.strip() method. This method removes leading (start) and trailing (end) whitespace characters, including spaces, tabs, and newline characters, from the string.
# In[21]:


#Example
original_string = "   Hello, World!   "
stripped_string = original_string.strip()

print(stripped_string)
