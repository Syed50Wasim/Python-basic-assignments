    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "ans:-\n",
    "Functions allow you to break down your code into smaller, manageable pieces. \n",
    "Each function can perform a specific task or solve a specific problem. \n",
    "This modular approach makes your code more organized and easier to understand, debug, and maintain.\n",
    "Once you define a function, you can use it multiple times throughout your program without rewriting the same code.This promotes code reusability and helps you avoid redundancy in your codebase. Functions simplify the testing and debugging process. You can isolate and test individual functions, making it easier to identify and fix issues. This isolation also helps in unit testing and test-driven development.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.When does the code in a function run: when its specified or when its called?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "The code in a function runs when it's called, not when it's specified or defined.\n",
    "When you define a function, you are essentially creating a blueprint or a set of instructions.The actual execution of those instructions happens when you call the function in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What statement creates a function?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "The statement used to create a function is typically called a \"function declaration\" or a \"function definition.\"The specific syntax can vary slightly between languages, but in general, you use the def keyword in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "A function and a function call are related concepts in programming, but they serve different purposes\n",
    "Function: A function, also known as a function definition or declaration, is a block of code that defines a particular task or operation. It encapsulates a set of instructions that can be executed when the function is called. Functions are designed to be reusable and can accept input parameters and return output values.\n",
    "Function Call: A function call, also known as invoking or executing a function, is the action of actually running the code within a function. When you call a function, you use its name followed by parentheses () to pass any required arguments and trigger the execution of the function's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Python program, there is exactly one global scope and potentially multiple local scopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global Scope: There is one global scope for the entire program. Variables defined in the global scope are accessible from anywhere within the program, including inside functions.\n",
    "Variables defined outside of any function or class are in the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local Scopes: Local scopes are created whenever a function is called. Each function call creates a new local scope. Variables defined within a function are local to that function and cannot be directly accessed from outside that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6.What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function call in Python returns, the variables defined in the local scope of that function are destroyed or deallocated. This means they are no longer accessible or available for use outside the function. This behavior is known as \"variable scope\" or \"variable lifetime.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7.What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a return value in programming is the value that a function gives back to the caller when it completes its execution. When you call a function, it can perform various operations, manipulate data, and compute a result. The return value is how the function communicates that result to the code that called it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8.If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "If a function in Python does not have a return statement, or if it has a return statement without an expression, the function will implicitly return None. None is a special Python object that represents the absence of a value or the lack of a return value.\n",
    "It's important to note that None is a valid return value in Python, and functions that don't need to return a specific result often use return statements without an expression to make it clear that they intentionally return None.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "In Python, if you want to make a function variable refer to a global variable, you can use the global keyword inside the function to explicitly declare that you want to work with the global variable instead of creating a new local variable with the same name. This allows you to modify or access the global variable from within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10.What is the data type of None?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "In Python, None is a special singleton object representing the absence of a value or the lack of a return value. It is not associated with any specific data type. Instead, it has its own unique data type, which is NoneType.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11.What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "The sentence \"import areallyourpetsnamederic\" does not have any specific built-in meaning in Python. It appears to be an arbitrary statement that is unlikely to be a valid Python import statement.\n",
    "In Python, the import statement is used to import modules or packages that contain reusable code. The module or package specified after the import keyword should be a valid Python module or package name. In this case, \"areallyourpetsnamederic\" does not appear to be a standard Python module or package name, so this import statement would result in an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12.If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "After importing the spam module, you can call the bacon() function from the spam module by prefixing it with the module name using dot notation. Here's how you would call the bacon() function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "To prevent a program from crashing when it encounters an error, you can implement error handling techniques. Error handling allows you to gracefully handle exceptions or unexpected situations in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these error-handling techniques, you can make your program more robust and resilient to unexpected issues, reducing the chances of crashes and improving user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "In Python, the try and except clauses are used together in a try-except block to handle exceptions, errors, or unexpected situations that might occur during the execution of a program.By using try and except together, you can gracefully handle exceptions and prevent your program from crashing when errors occur during execution."
